4. Default LibGuide widgets can do some of the heavy lifting of grabbing the xml feed and displaying it.
 
However, the default version will display the images, but only as list items.   See "Example RSS Widget ID 3475169" to  for further explanation.  Additional JS/jQuery is needed to put them into a carousel.
 
5. The location of the JavaScript/ jQuery used in the digital.usfsp.edu page are  
 
"http://digital.usfsp.edu/assets/floatbox/modules/core_534.js  
"http://digital.usfsp.edu/assets/scripts/bpbootstrap-20160726.pack.js"
 
These js link have been added to the "Custom JS/CSS Code" area for RSS Tests, as well as, to the individual Example RSS Widget for manipulation..
